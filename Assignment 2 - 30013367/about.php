    <p>The SCP Foundation[note 3] is a fictional organization documented by the web-based collaborative-fiction project of the same name. Within the website&#39;s fictional setting, the SCP Foundation is responsible for locating and containing individuals,
        entities, locations, and objects that violate natural law (referred to as SCPs). The real-world website is community-based and includes elements of many genres such as horror, science fiction, and urban fantasy.</p>
    <p>On the SCP Foundation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a>, the majority of works consist of &quot;special containment procedures&quot;: structured internal documentation that describes an SCP object and the means of keeping it contained.

        well as for its high standards of quality.<br /></p>
